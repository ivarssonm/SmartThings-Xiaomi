# SmartThings-Xiaomi

It is highly recommended that you use the device handler posted at bsprangers repo below.  I consider that the "gold" DH as it has been updated with input from a number of community members to get them working properly.

This DH I have posted here I am mainly using for testing and may not be the most stable version.

------------------------

This was copied from bspranger's repo (https://github.com/bspranger/Xiaomi/tree/master/devicetypes/a4refillpad/xiaomi-aqara-door-window-sensor.src) and
modified to work with my specific Xiaomi Aqara Door/Window Sensors.

I don't know if they will work on others but this is what I had to do to get it to work with mine.

Everything you need to know about them and SmartThings is in this thread.
